### Background and Purpose
The goal of this review is to:
1. Assess the Bakery display for quality, cleanliness, accessibility, and stock performance.
2. Highlight any missed sales opportunities (e.g., missing product types like sourdough loaves, baguettes, or packaged gluten-free bread).
3. Ensure alignment with customer expectations for location type (e.g., supermarkets vs. convenience stores).
4. Produce actionable insights to improve display performance.
5. Review the products being sold to determine if they are the best options based on customer demand, variety, and shelf allocation.

### Detailed Scoring Methodology
Use the following subsections for the review. **Each category must be scored out of 10, weighted as outlined, and include detailed reasoning.**

#### 1. Cleanliness (Weight: 5%)
   - Evaluate the cleanliness of the bakery area, including shelves, counters, and surrounding areas.
   - Deduct heavily for visible crumbs, smudges, or packaging debris.
   - Assess if displays are dust-free and free of clutter that detracts from the presentation of baked goods.

#### 2. Product Accessibility (Weight: 7%)
   - Assess whether customers can easily see, reach, and select breads and baked items.
   - Deduct for items placed on overly high or low shelves that reduce accessibility.
   - Evaluate open counters for overcrowding, ensuring items are well-spaced and easy to pick up.

#### 3. Shelf Standards (Weight: 14%)
   - Review the organization and tidiness of shelves or counters.  
   - Deduct for bread piles that appear messy or unappealing.
   - Score poorly for mismatched or unattractive packaging of bagged bread.
   - Deduct heavily if pricing strips or labels are obscured or misplaced.

#### 4. Stock Levels (Weight: 14%)
   - Check for adequate stock levels of high-demand items:
     - White bread, wholemeal bread, baguettes, sourdough, rolls, and croissants.
   - Empty shelf space indicates missed sales and should result in point deductions.
   - Deduct heavily for running out of staple bread types, such as white and wholemeal loaves.

#### 5. Promotions & Signage (Weight: 10%)
   - Evaluate promotional signage (e.g., multi-buy offers or discounts) for clarity and visibility.
   - Deduct for excessive or cluttered signage that confuses customers.
   - Highlight the importance of prominent signage for "freshly baked" or "artisanal" items.

#### 6. Pricing Clarity (Weight: 5%)
   - Assess whether pricing is clearly visible and easy to understand.
   - Deduct heavily for missing or inconsistent pricing on both bagged and fresh bread.

#### 7. Product Visibility (Weight: 5%)
   - Ensure all product types are easily visible and appealing.  
   - Deduct for any bread placed in shadowed areas or obstructed by other items.
   - Evaluate lighting and presentation for enhancing freshness and quality appeal.

#### 8. Key Bakery Items (Weight: 10%)
   - Ensure the presence of high-demand items like white bread, rolls, sourdough, and baguettes.
   - Deduct heavily for missing product diversity, such as gluten-free or seeded loaves.

#### 9. Freshness Focus (Weight: 5%)
   - Ensure open counters display bread that looks fresh and recently baked.
   - Deduct for stale or dry-looking products on display.
   - Highlight missed sales opportunities if freshness isn’t emphasized (e.g., rotating product placement).

#### 10. Location Suitability (Weight: 5%)
   - Assess whether the product range matches the demographic and traffic flow of the location.
   - Deduct for over-reliance on premium-priced bread in budget-focused areas or missing artisanal products in affluent areas.

#### 11. Shopability (Weight: 10%)
   - Evaluate the layout and ease with which customers can navigate the display.
   - Deduct for cramped or overly busy arrangements that confuse customers or make product selection difficult.

#### 12. Key Products in Ranges (Weight: 10%)
   - High-priority products (e.g., sourdough, white and wholemeal bread, baguettes) must be given prominence.
   - Deduct heavily if less popular items take valuable shelf space over top sellers.

#### 13. Brand Presence & Relevance (Weight: 5%)
   - Evaluate the inclusion of relevant brands (e.g., Warburtons, Hovis, or local bakeries for bagged bread).
   - Deduct for poor alignment with customer expectations (e.g., limited choice or missing trusted brands).

### Commercial Sales Opportunities
For any missing items or underperforming areas:
1. Highlight missed opportunities such as:
   - Adding gluten-free loaves or artisanal bread varieties.
